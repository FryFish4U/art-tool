This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Using the Art-Tool

The Art-Tool uses html's Canvas Element for user-feedback and interactibility and is difficult to fully make mobile compatible.
Hopefully, the current adjustments in the page's layout is sufficient even though it's not perfect.

## Notes

Some previous functionalities aren't available anymore; since this code was made for a course project. Persistance and User Data Storage features has been cut due to this.  

I've taken time and disabled (hopefully) all parts of the code that would be deprecated.
